# Gifasent

Prototype team project that is based on the idea of enabling gif-sending. Built in a span of
36 hours for Des Moines Startup Weekend. The startup came in 1st place. Built with teammates
Garret Meier and Luke Geiken. Has since been remodeled by the two. The project is done in
common web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with the use of Cordova to port to Android/iOS
applications. The app is also hosted on Parse. It makes use of the Firebase SDK, Facebook SDK,
and Giphy library.
